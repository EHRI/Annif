This is a small corpus based on subjects and Finnish language documents in
the archaeology domain. It is mainly intended for unit testing.

The 125 subjects were selected from the YSO archaeology group, extracted
from YSO release 2018.3 Boethius. Metadata from the Finna.fi service was
used to collect suitable texts for each subject.

The vocabulary is a small subset of 130 concepts related to archaeology that
have been extracted from the General Finnish Ontology YSO.

The SPARQL CONSTRUCT query used for extracting the subset is included in the
file `extract-yso-archaeology.rq`.

YSO is copyrighted by National Library of Finland, Semantic Computing
Research Group (SeCo) and The Finnish Terminology Centre TSK. It is used
here according to the CC By 4.0 license.

The 28 documents were selected from the Ask a librarian (Kysy
kirjastonhoitajalta) service. They are broadly related to the topic of
archaeology.
